There are 50 variables in the myTidyDataset

subjectId
activityId is coded 1-6 as follows: 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

For each activity there are multiple measurments with multiple signals measured for each.  For each of these variables 
the mean and standard deviation were measured (mean()), std()).  Nomenclature for these various signals are as follows, with
X, Y, and Z each having a unique measurement.  For complete definitions of these variables, please see "features_info.txt" that
was provided with the original datadownload.
