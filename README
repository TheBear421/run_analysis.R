This README file outlines how the script for run_analysis.R works.

After downloading the files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should unzip them and get familiar with the different files within them.  There is a short descript of the unzipped fies
and folders within the script.

The script takes you step by step through this Assignment, which has the following objectives:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
6) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

I hope you find the descriptions within the script useful as you walk through the script and ultimately see the ending
tidy file.  It is very important that your downloaded zip file is in your working directory, and the test and training
files in the working directory for this script to work properly.
